= KFSM Turnstile Sample for Browser

A simple application to demonstrate implementing [KFSM](https://github.com/open-jumpco/kfsm) with the classic Turnstile FSM.

This implementation uses Kotlin code to manipulate the register event handlers on the buttons and manipulate the DOM to update the display state of the elements.

```bash
./gradlew build
```

All the files needed to run will be in `build/dist`

Or you can launch it using

```bash
./gradlew browserRun
```
